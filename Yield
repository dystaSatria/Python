# A Simple Python program to demonstrate working
# of yield

# A generator function that yields 1 for the first time,
# 2 second time and 3 third time
def simpleGeneratorFun():
yield 1
yield 2
yield 3

# Driver code to check above generator function
for value in simpleGeneratorFun():
print(value)
Output:

1

3


# An Infinite loop to generate squares
while True:

def generator():

   yield "Welcome"

   yield "to"

   yield "Simplilearn"

print(type(gen_object))

for i in gen_object:

   print(i)

#Output : Welcome
          To

# Use of yield
def printresult(String): 
   for i in String: 
      if i == "p": 
         yield i 

# Initializing string 
String = "Happy Birthday" 
ans = 0
print ("The number of 'p' in word is: ", end = "" ) 
String = String.strip() 

for j in printresult(String): 
   ans = ans + 1

print (ans)

#Output : The number of 'p' in word is: 2
#if we change the "yield" section with the "return" the Output will be : The number of 'p' in word is: 1
