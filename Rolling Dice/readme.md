# Dice Roll Simulation

This project simulates the rolling of a six-sided dice using Python. When executed, it randomly selects a number between 1 and 6, inclusive, and prints a visual representation of the dice face corresponding to the number.

## How It Works

The script uses the `random` module to generate a random integer between 1 and 6, each representing a side of a six-sided dice. Depending on the number generated, a pattern that represents the dice face is printed to the console.

### Patterns Representation

- **1:** A single dot in the middle
- **2:** A dot on the top right and bottom left
- **3:** Three dots in a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right
- **4:** Four dots in each corner
- **5:** Four dots in each corner and one in the middle
- **6:** Two columns of three dots each
