# Reverse Number explanation

You can solve it by string fuction or with loop combination

## 1. String Function

Remember with the ```stringVariable[1:2:1] ``` .
That means ```stringVariable[start : stop : step]```. For negative indexing, to display the 1st element to last element in steps of 1 in reverse order, we use the ```[::-1]```. The ```[::-1]``` reverses the order.
