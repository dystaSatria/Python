# Yield

The Yield keyword in Python is similar to a 
<span style="color:red">
Text_content
</span>  
statement used for returning values or objects in Python.  

## Different from 'return'

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to instal
```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
