# Roman To Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: ```I```, ```V```, ```X```, ```L```, ```C```, ```D``` and ```M```.



| Symbol |      Value     |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| I  |  1   |
| V  |  5   | 
|  X |  10  |
|  L |  50   |
|  C  |    100   |
|  D   |   500    |
|  M   |   1000    |

For example, 2 is written as ```II``` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as ```XII```, which is simply ```X + II```. The number 27 is written as ```XXVII```, which is ```XX + V + II```.
